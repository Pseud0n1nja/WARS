    "We are _Best Film Recommenders (BFR)_, a company located in NYC and founded by two Columbia Students in 2014. Since our inception, we have been recognized by our users for our accurate and personalized movie recommendations. However, our industry is always evolving, requiring constant improvements to remain competitive and profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A week ago we received a letter from _Wes Anderson Productions (WAP)_, the company which owns the rights for every movie directed by Wes Anderson. Within the letter they claim that despite the high quality of Wes Anderson's films, most of his work is still unknown by most consumers. The only exceptions are _The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)_ (which received critical acclaim, including nine Oscars nominations), and _Isle of Dogs (2018)_, which popularity was boosted by the former's success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to WAP films having high ratings yet low viewership, the company believes that six of Wes Anderson's films are unpopular due to a lack of publicity when they were released. With the Christmas season approaching, WAP believe that target advertising can bring in new viewers that never knew the movies existed, increasing revenue from movie sales. For this reason, WAP are willing to pay a significant sum of money if we can reach 1,000 users, representing a significant potential income for our company.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we could recommend the six movies to all our users, our company's mission has always been focussed on our users, and we don't want to make recommendations they can find irrelevant. Because of this, we would like to find the movie which is most likely to be enjoyed by each user among the following films: \n",
    "\n",
    "* _Rushmore (1998)_\n",
    "* _The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)_\n",
    "* _The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)_\n",
    "* _The Darjeeling Limited (2007)_\n",
    "* _Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)_\n",
    "* _Moonrise Kingdom (2012)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our goal will be to build a new _Wes Anderson Recommendation System (WARS)_, to find the ideal movie per user. While we have no _accuracy cutoff_, we want our recommendations to be as targeted as possible to keep a high availability of advertising space, should new clients wish to use our services."

All with the intention to find what works and what doesn't for the first release of _WARS_."
